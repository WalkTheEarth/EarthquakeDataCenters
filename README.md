Earthquake Data Center Link Collection
---
This repository maintains four Markdown files, cataloguing public earthquake data centers adhering to particular data formats: FDSNWS, SEEDLink, Earthworm and Winston.

Files

Located directly under the project's root folder, you will encounter the following files:

[Earthworm.md](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/WalkTheEarth/EarthquakeDataCenters/main/Earthworm.md)
- Enumerates URLs leading to Earthworm-compatible data centers. All entries appear consecutively, separated merely by line breaks.

[Seedlinks.md](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/WalkTheEarth/EarthquakeDataCenters/main/Seedlinks.md) 
- Assembles URLs connected to SEEDLink-compatible data centers, sequentially ordered and divided using line breaks.

[FDSNWS.md](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/WalkTheEarth/EarthquakeDataCenters/main/FDSNWS.md) 
- Accumulates URLs associated with FDSN Web Services (FDSNWS)-compatible data centers. Individual items are aligned without interruptions besides those imposed by line breaks.

[Winston.md](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/WalkTheEarth/EarthquakeDataCenters/main/Winston.md)
- Accumulates URLs associated with Winston Wave-compatible data centers. Individual items are aligned without interruptions besides those imposed by line breaks.

Due to brevity constraints, these textual compilations refrain from incorporating further elaboration beyond the mere enumeration of URLs. Nevertheless, they aim to offer value despite minimal embellishment.

Kindly inform us about any perceived inconsistencies or suggest potential improvements through issues or pull requests. Your collaboration remains crucial, and we always strive to better our materials accordingly. Enjoy exploring these datasets!
